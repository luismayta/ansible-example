===============

This code of conduct applies to the payment project and all associated
projects in the `ansible-example <https://github.com/luismayta/ansible-example>`__
organization.

When Something Happens
----------------------

If you see a Code of Conduct violation, follow these steps:

1. Let the person know that what they did is not appropriate and ask
   them to stop and/or edit their message(s) or commits.
2. That person should immediately stop the behavior and correct the
   issue.

When reporting, please include any relevant details, links, screenshots,
context, or other information that may be used to better understand and
resolve the situation.

Our Pledge
----------

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers of this project pledge to making
participation in our community a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, technical preferences,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

Our Standards
-------------

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

-  Using welcoming and inclusive language.
-  Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
-  Gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
-  Focusing on what is best for the community.
-  Showing empathy and kindness towards other community members.
-  Encouraging and raising up your peers in the project so you can all
   bask in hacks and glory.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

-  The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual
   attention or advances, including when simulated online. The only
   exception to sexual topics is channels/spaces specifically for topics
   of sexual identity.
-  Casual mention of slavery or indentured servitude and/or false
   comparisons of one's occupation or situation to slavery. Please
   consider using or asking about alternate terminology when referring
   to such metaphors in technology.
-  Making light of/making mocking comments about trigger warnings and
   content warnings.
-  Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political
   attacks.
-  Public or private harassment, deliberate intimidation, or threats.
-  Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or
   electronic address, without explicit permission. This includes any
   sort of "outing" of any aspect of someone's identity without their
   consent.
-  Publishing private screenshots or quotes of interactions in the
   context of this project without all quoted users' *explicit* consent.
-  Publishing of private communication that doesn't have to do with
   reporting harrassment.
-  Any of the above even when `presented as "ironic" or
   "joking" <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_racism>`__.
-  Any attempt to present "reverse-ism" versions of the above as
   violations. Examples of reverse-isms are "reverse racism", "reverse
   sexism", "heterophobia", and "cisphobia".
-  Unsolicited explanations under the assumption that someone doesn't
   already know it. Ask before you teach! Don't assume what people's
   knowledge gaps are.
-  `Feigning or exaggerating
   surprise <https://www.recurse.com/manual#no-feigned-surprise>`__ when
   someone admits to not knowing something.
-  "`Well-actuallies <https://www.recurse.com/manual#no-well-actuallys>`__"
-  Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
   professional or community setting.

Scope
-----

This Code of Conduct applies both within spaces involving this project
and in other spaces involving community members. This includes the
repository, its Pull Requests and Issue tracker, its Twitter community,
private email communications in the context of the project, and any
events where members of the project are participating, as well as
adjacent communities and venues affecting the project's members.

Depending on the violation, the maintainers may decide that violations
of this code of conduct that have happened outside of the scope of the
community may deem an individual unwelcome, and take appropriate action
to maintain the comfort and safety of its members.

Other Community Standards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a project on Gitlab, this project is additionally covered by the
`Gitlab Community
Guidelines <https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/>`__.

Enforcement of those guidelines after violations overlapping with the
above are the responsibility of the entities, and enforcement may happen
in any or all of the services/communities.

Maintainer Enforcement Process
------------------------------

Once the maintainers get involved, they will follow a documented series
of steps and do their best to preserve the well-being of project
members. This section covers actual concrete steps.

This Code of Conduct is based
on `Trio's Code of Conduct <https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code-of-conduct.html>`_, which is based on the
`WeAllJS Code of Conduct <https://wealljs.org/code-of-conduct>`__, which
is itself based on `Contributor
Covenant <http://contributor-covenant.org>`__, version 1.4, available at
http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4, and the LGBTQ in Technology
Slack `Code of Conduct <http://lgbtq.technology/coc.html>`__.
